1. Keras Sequential and Functional
There are 2 ways to build Keras model: sequential and functional
- The Sequential allows you to create models layer-by-layer for most problems. It is limited in that 
it does not allow you to create models that share layers or have multiple inputs or outputs.
- The Functional allows you to create models that have more flexibility as you can define models where 
layers connect to more than just the previous and next layers. You can connect layers to any other layer.

2. Softmax Activation Function
- The Softmax function is used as the activation function in the output layer of neural networks models that 
predicts a multinomial probability distribution
=> Softmax is used as the activation function for multi-class classification problems where class membership
is required on more than 2 class labels.


3. Optimizer Adam (another optimization algorithm beside Gradient Descent)
- Adam optimization is a stochastic gradient descent method that is based on adaptive estimation of first-order
and second-order moments


4. Loss Function: categorical_crossentropy
- Computes the crossentropy loss between the labels and predictions. This loss functions is used when 
there are 2 or more labels classes. (Expect labels to be provided in a one-hot representation)
- One-hot representation: the integer encoded variable is removed and a new binary variable is added for each 
unique integer value. (As like in one vs all lecture of Machine Learning. Encode binary variables for integer numbers
from 1 to 10)


5. Metrics: Accuracy
- Calculates how often predictions equal labels
